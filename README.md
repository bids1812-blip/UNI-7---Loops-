# STUDY OF LOOPS IN PYTHON

## AIM
To study and understand the concept of looping statements in Python and to implement repetition of tasks using different types of loops and loop control statements.

## THEORY

Loops are control flow statements used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is satisfied or for each element in a sequence. They reduce code repetition and make programs efficient and structured.
In Python, loops are mainly classified into two types:
1. While Loop
2. For Loop

Loops are fundamental in programming and are widely used in solving problems involving repetition, iteration, and accumulation of results.

The while loop executes a block of statements repeatedly as long as the given condition remains True. It is generally used when the number of iterations is not known in advance.

The loop checks the condition before executing the block. If the condition becomes False, the loop terminates.

The while loop is commonly used for:

1. Counting operations

2. Input validation

3. Repeating tasks until a condition is met

4. Traversing through data using counters

5. Proper updating of the loop variable is essential to prevent infinite loops.

The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence such as a list, string, or range of numbers. It is generally used when the number of iterations is known beforehand.

The for loop automatically handles iteration and is more concise and readable compared to the while loop when working with sequences.

The for loop is commonly used for:

1. Iterating through numbers

2. Traversing lists and arrays

3. Calculating sums

4. Printing patterns

5. Processing collections of data

## LOOP CONTROL STATEMENTS

Loop control statements are used to alter the normal flow of loops.

Break Statement
The break statement immediately terminates the loop when a specific condition is met. Control moves to the statement following the loop.

Continue Statement
The continue statement skips the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop without terminating it.

Pass Statement
The pass statement is a null statement. It is used as a placeholder when a statement is required syntactically but no action needs to be performed.

These control statements help in writing efficient and flexible loop structures.

## APPLICATIONS OF LOOPS

Loops are widely used in real-world programming applications such as:

1. Printing number sequences

2. Finding sum or average of numbers

3. Filtering even or odd numbers

4. Searching elements in a list

5. Repeating menu-driven programs

6. Data processing and analysis

7. Pattern printing

They are essential for implementing algorithms and solving computational problems.

## ADVANTAGES OF LOOPS

1. Reduces code redundancy.

2. Makes programs shorter and more readable.

3. Improves efficiency in handling repetitive tasks.

4. Essential for handling large data sets.

5. Simplifies problem-solving involving iteration.

## COMMON ERRORS

1. Forgetting to update the loop variable in while loops, leading to infinite loops.

2. Incorrect loop conditions.

3. Improper indentation.

4. Logical errors in break or continue usage.

5. Off-by-one errors in iteration ranges.

6. Avoiding these mistakes ensures correct and efficient execution of loop statements.

## CONCLUSION

Thus, the study of loops in Python was successfully completed. We understood the working of while loops and for loops along with loop control statements such as break, continue, and pass. Loops play a vital role in programming by enabling repetition and efficient execution of tasks. They are fundamental constructs used in almost every real-world application and algorithm.
